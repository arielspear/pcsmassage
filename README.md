####Original Client Requests####

1. the same header, footer, and navigation menu on each page<br/>
2. a navigation menu with at least 3 items (each is a link to a new page) ­­ “home” should NOT be one of the options (that’s what the logo is for in the header)<br/>
3. an “offerings” page with her 5 menu offerings (hot stone massage, deep tissue, etc.), with one­sentence descriptions and the prices. These may be displayed in one of three ways: 1) in a table, 2) a single content area with multiple tabs, 3) using headers and p tags<br/>
4. her contact information (phone, email, mailing address)<br/>
5. an embedded google map with her location centered<br/>
6. logo and catch phrase in the header ­­ make the logo a clickable image, that is a link to the home page<br/>
7. copyright in the footer with your team name<br/>
8. social media links in either the footer or the header<br/>
9. a “feedback” page with an embedded form/survey with 3 questions: 1) Did you have a positive experience? 2) Would you recommend us to a friend? 3) Do you want me to contact you to set up another appointment? ­­ it’s recommended that you use either wufoo or google docs for this<br/>
10. a “links” page with links to other articles and resources ­­ this page should have at least one PDF available for downloading<br/>
11. a sweet little favicon that shows up in the browser tabs<br/>
12. a sidebar that has a different image and quote on each page<br/>
13. a seamless, repeatable background texture on the page with the menu options<br/>
14. make the site responsive, using media queries<br/>
15. advanced (optional): use a CDN for Bootstrap, and use Bootstrap components on each page to give the site a consistent look and feel (http://getbootstrap.com/ and http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)<br/>
