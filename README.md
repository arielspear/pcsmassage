####Remote Use####
After meeting up at Hack and Help this week, Git isn't exactly the proper tool for this assignment given we're creating a stack of static pages. We'll run into some crazy merge requests if we're not careful, so here's the plan:

The main structure of the site as it is now we have to clone to fit the content of about.html, offerings.html, etc. I'll continue to make changes to the main index.html and pcsmassage.css as the assignment goes on. I'll leave clear html comments on where to place content for each unique page.

So, if Ariel, for example, is working on offerings.html, she'll create the content for that page and copy/paste whatever changes I push to the master branch in index.html to the beginning and ending of her about.html (again, this is fairly clear in within the comments).

>1. the same header, footer, and navigation menu on each page<br/>
2. a navigation menu with at least 3 items (each is a link to a new page) ­­ “home” should NOT be one of the options (that’s what the logo is for in the header)<br/>
3. an “offerings” page with her 5 menu offerings (hot stone massage, deep tissue, etc.), with one­sentence descriptions and the prices. These may be displayed in one of three ways: 1) in a table, 2) a single content area with multiple tabs, 3) using headers and p tags<br/>
4. her contact information (phone, email, mailing address)<br/>
5. an embedded google map with her location centered<br/>
6. logo and catch phrase in the header ­­ make the logo a clickable image, that is a link to the home page<br/>
7. copyright in the footer with your team name<br/>
8. social media links in either the footer or the header<br/>
9. a “feedback” page with an embedded form/survey with 3 questions: 1) Did you have a positive experience? 2) Would you recommend us to a friend? 3) Do you want me to contact you to set up another appointment? ­­ it’s recommended that you use either wufoo or google docs for this<br/>
10. a “links” page with links to other articles and resources ­­ this page should have at least one PDF available for downloading<br/>
11. a sweet little favicon that shows up in the browser tabs<br/>
12. a sidebar that has a different image and quote on each page<br/>
13. a seamless, repeatable background texture on the page with the menu options<br/>
14. make the site responsive, using media queries<br/>
15. advanced (optional): use a CDN for Bootstrap, and use Bootstrap components on each page to give the site a consistent look and feel (http://getbootstrap.com/ and http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)<br/>
