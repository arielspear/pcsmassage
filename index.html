            <h1>Forget-Me-Now</h1>
            <p>I care deeply for nature. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. I'm half machine. I'm a monster.</p>
            <h2>Exit Strategy</h2>
            <p>Michael! No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. That's why you always leave a note! It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. I'm a monster.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast.</li>
            <li>I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it.</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Ready, Aim, Marry Me</h3>
            <p>Well, what do you expect, mother? Well, what do you expect, mother? Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. Across from where? Really? Did nothing cancel? That's why you always leave a note!</p>
            <h4>Good Grief!</h4>
            <p>There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. Guy's a pro. Across from where? As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. Marry me.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>I'm afraid I just blue myself.</li>
            <li>Michael!</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Afternoon delight</h5>
            <p>As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. I'm a monster. Well, what do you expect, mother?</p>
