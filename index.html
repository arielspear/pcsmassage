                <p>We just call it a sausage. I've opened a door here that I regret. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. I care deeply for nature.</p>

                <p>Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. No&hellip; but I'd like to be asked! Michael! Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.</p>

                <li>Whoa, this guy's straight?</li>
                <li>I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it.</li>

                <h3>Ready, Aim, Marry Me</h3>
                <p>Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! Marry me. Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! Steve Holt!</p>
                <h4>Afternoon delight</h4>
                <p>Not tricks, Michael, illusions. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. Whoa, this guy's straight? He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish.</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Well, what do you expect, mother?</li>
                <li>But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore?</li>
                <li>I'm afraid I just blue myself.</li>

                <p>Whoa, this guy's straight? I hear the jury's still out on science. Guy's a pro. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun.</p>
